## Excalibur/Breakout

Playing around with the [Excalibur](https://excaliburjs.com/) TS game engine, and expanding/improving upon the tutorial documentation. That's not to say that the tutorial is not helpful, but it covers only a very small percentage of using the engine.

What I'm hoping to do here:

- Flesh out the tutorial into a full game, with menus, transitions, win/lose conditions, sprites, sounds, etc. Just a little bit of everything the engine has to offer.
- Get an in-depth understanding of the engine, and maybe abstract or add onto some of the parts I don't care for.
- Get a nice Webpack setup going for running in dev and properly building for prod.

I will update this as I go, hopefully with notes about what I've built, and a link to where the final product is deployed. (Bearing in mind no matter how much work I do, it's still Breakout, so it will only ever be mildly interesting.)
